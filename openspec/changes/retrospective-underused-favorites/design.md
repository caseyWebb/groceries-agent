## Context

`retrospective` is a pure aggregation (`src/retrospective.ts`) fed by the tool wrapper (`src/cooking-tools.ts → loadRetrospective`), which loads **every** `cooking_log` row for the tenant (the query has no date bound — windowing happens in the pure function) and merges the recipe index with the caller's overlay (`favorite`/`reject`) and derived `last_cooked` into an effective index.

Today `underused` is built by walking that whole index and emitting every non-rejected recipe whose `last_cooked` is null or older than the period window's start (`src/retrospective.ts:128-141`), uncapped. Because the corpus is **communal and discovery-oriented** — most recipes have never been cooked by any one member — and the window is short, this set is approximately the entire shared library minus the handful cooked recently, and it grows as the library grows. Every call silently injects it into the agent's context. (Confirmed: the only consumer that needs the field is the `cooking-retrospective` skill, whose job is to offer one or two recipes to revive.)

The supporting signals already exist: `favorite`/`reject` are per-tenant overlay booleans merged by `mergeOverlay`; `season` is a required may-be-empty string array on every recipe; cook history is the same `cooking_log` rows already loaded. So the fix is a rewrite of one function plus a season-vocabulary pin — no new query, no new storage.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Make `underused` bounded by the caller's *own taste*, not the library size, and make it honestly mean "loved things that have gone quiet."
- Capture love declared (favorite) **and** revealed (cooked repeatedly), so the lazy-curator case still surfaces.
- Stop nagging with out-of-season recipes.
- Keep the contract (impl ↔ `docs/TOOLS.md` ↔ `cooking-history` spec) in lockstep; ship with no data migration.

**Non-Goals:**
- Hard write-time validation of `season` against the canonical vocab (a future change can add a `SEASON_VOCAB` gate to the validators the way `EQUIPMENT_VOCAB` is gated). This change normalizes on read so the feature ships immediately.
- Location/hemisphere-aware season derivation. A single self-hosted Worker serves one friend group; Northern-hemisphere months are a documented assumption.
- Surfacing the communal "never cooked by me" discovery set — that is `search_recipes` / discovery territory, deliberately *not* `underused`.
- Auto-starring a revealed favorite (the "graduate to a real favorite" idea is left as a future thread).

## Decisions

### D1 — Membership: loved ∩ stale ∩ in-season, never rejected
`underused = (declared favorite ∪ revealed favorite) ∩ stale ∩ in-season ∩ ¬rejected`. This replaces "not cooked in the window" with a curated-signal gate, which is what bounds the set. *Alternatives:* favorites-only (simplest, but misses the lazy-curator's revealed loves); keep the definition but just cap to top-N (still semantically "everything," just truncated — the count would be meaningless and the tail arbitrary); drop `underused` entirely and lean on `search_recipes(not_cooked_since)` (clean separation, but loses the one-call "summary + a couple to revive" beat the skill wants).

### D2 — Revealed favorite = cooked ≥ 3 times in the trailing 12 months
A behavioral love signal with a recency horizon. The trailing window ages out old phases automatically (a 2024 obsession stops counting in 2026) without the user having to reject anything. *Alternatives:* all-time count ≥ 3 (sticky — resurfaces retired phases forever); threshold of 2 (too weak — two cooks is a coincidence, not a pattern). Both the threshold (3) and horizon (12 months) are single constants, easy to tune. Computed in the pure function from the already-loaded rows — zero extra I/O.

### D3 — Staleness is a fixed 30 days, decoupled from `period`
`period` drives the summary aggregates; `underused` always uses `now − 30d`. This kills the current cross-period incoherence (where `week` / `month` / `all` each produced a wildly different `underused`) and gives the field one stable meaning. A recipe cooked once a year is still underused if that once wasn't in the last 30 days — recency is the rule, not frequency. *Alternative:* scale staleness with the window (re-introduces the incoherence and the over-inclusion for short windows).

### D4 — Season: derive current season from `now`, hard-exclude out-of-season
`seasonOf(now)` via Northern-hemisphere meteorological months (Dec–Feb winter, Mar–May spring, Jun–Aug summer, Sep–Nov fall). A recipe with `season: []` is year-round and always passes; a non-empty `season` must include the current season or it is dropped. *Alternatives:* down-rank rather than exclude (the ask was "don't show out-of-season things" — a hard filter); surface "coming into season soon" (nice, but speculative and out of scope).

### D5 — Pin a canonical `SEASON_VOCAB`, normalize on read, stage write enforcement
Add `SEASON_VOCAB = [spring, summer, fall, winter]` to `src/vocab.js` (with `src/vocab.d.ts`). The retrospective season match normalizes both sides (case-fold, `autumn → fall`) so legacy free-text data matches with no migration. Write-side canonicalization (classifier guidance in `AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, an optional soft validator check) is a staged follow-on. *Alternative:* hard-gate `season` at write time now (matches the `EQUIPMENT_VOCAB` pattern, but would reject existing recipes carrying legacy tokens until migrated — exactly the migration we want to avoid).

### D6 — One tagged list + a total count + a top-15 cap
Return a single `underused` list, each item tagged `why: "favorite" | "revealed"` and `cook_count` (all-time) so the skill can phrase "you starred this but never made it" vs "you used to make this all the time" differently. `underused_count` carries the pre-cap total; the list is capped to the 15 stalest. The cap is defense-in-depth against a power user who has favorited or revealed hundreds — the original bug's ghost. *Alternative:* two separate lists (`favorites` / `revealed`) — more surface for no real gain, since the skill treats them the same way.

### D7 — `cook_count` is all-time; qualification count is trailing-12-month
The number surfaced for the nudge is the caller's all-time cook count ("you've made this 9 times"), which reads better than the trailing slice. Revealed *qualification* still uses the trailing-12-month count. The two counts can differ (a recipe cooked 9 times total but only twice in the last year is *not* a revealed favorite) — that asymmetry is intentional and is the D2 aging behavior.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Revealed love is ambiguous: drifted-away vs burned-out.** The log can't distinguish "I loved this and forgot it" from "I got sick of it." → Explicit `reject` covers the strong case; for the rest the persona *offers* ("you used to make X a lot — still into it?") rather than asserting, consistent with its suggest-don't-nag stance.
- **Hemisphere assumption.** Northern-only `seasonOf`. → Documented as an assumption; acceptable for a single-region friend group; a future change can read profile location if a Southern-hemisphere operator appears.
- **Off-vocabulary season tokens beyond the known synonym.** A recipe tagged `season: ["monsoon"]` will never equal the derived season and is silently excluded from `underused`. → The canonical vocab + read-side `autumn→fall` cover the realistic cases; rare exotic tokens degrade to "treated as out of season," which is conservative (drops, never spuriously nags). The staged write-side canonicalization closes this fully.
- **The cap can hide genuinely-underused recipes.** → `underused_count` tells the agent how many were elided, and the full browse is `search_recipes(not_cooked_since=…)` with real filters. 15 stalest is plenty for one-or-two revival offers.

## Migration Plan

Pure-function rewrite plus a shared-constant addition — no schema or data migration. Read-side season normalization means existing recipes (including any legacy `season` values) work on first deploy. Ships via the normal path: merge to `main` → `ci.yml` dispatches the data repo's deploy. Rollback is a straight revert of `src/retrospective.ts` (and the `SEASON_VOCAB` addition, which nothing else depends on yet). The `cooking-retrospective` skill and `docs/TOOLS.md` update in the same pass; rebuild the plugin (`aubr build:plugin`).

## Open Questions

- **Tuning the revealed dials.** 3 cooks / 12 months is the starting point; real history may argue for 2 or for a 9-month horizon. Left as constants to revisit after dogfooding.
- **Graduating a revealed favorite into a declared one.** Should the skill offer to *star* a recipe the member clearly cooks a lot (turning revealed → declared)? Deferred — it adds a write beat to the skill and belongs in its own change.
